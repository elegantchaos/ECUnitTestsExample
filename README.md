This is an example project showing how to use the ECUnitTests framework.

This project builds two apps, with the catchy names "iOS Example" and "Mac Example".

The actual apps are just boiler-plate, created by Xcode.

Both of the apps have a unit test target too though, containing some tests.

You can run the tests by selecting the "iOS Example" or "Mac Example" scheme, then choosing "Test" from the "Product" menu.

Dependencies
------------

For this project to build, it needs to be able to find ECUnitTests.framework. 

The best way to do this is to add this project and the framework project to a worksheet.

See https://github.com/elegantchaos/ECUnitTestsIntegration of how to do this.
